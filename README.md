# Dchain Name Services
## It is a decentralized domain name service like (ens) on polygon blockchain.


We’re going to be making a smaller version of ENS on the Polygon blockchain: we’ll let anyone buy a domain NFT and point it to something. Any data it has will be universal! Anyone can read the names and look at what it’s pointing to. And because blockchains are so unstoppable, no one can remove your data or kill your epic domain.

### Mint your .nft domains as NFT in polygon blockchain at low cost.

## Running React on Repl.it

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the `.replit` file.
